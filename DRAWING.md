## Basics
* semi-colons are optional
* top-down order of operations
* camelCase for variables and functions
* createCanvas() (2D), or createGraphics() (3D)
* coordinate plane: (0,0) is top left (center for 3)
* (x, y) - x is horizantal, y is vertical
* non-pixel parameters are often between 0 and 255
* comment a line with //
* comment a block with /* */
* log values with console.log() -> careful! logging can slow down your program

* Reference: https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape

* Reference: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background
* background(color)
* greyscale, RGB, and alpha
* stroke(), fill(), noFill(), strokeWeight(), etc...
* beginShape(), endShape(), vertex(), etc...
## Variables
